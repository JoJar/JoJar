Hi, Iâ€™m Josh.

You can find a bit about me and my portfolio on my website [here](http://www.josh-jarvis.com/).

I'm spending most evenings playing around with React whilst conducting research for my MSc Dissertation.
For my dissertation I am also developing my knowledge of data analysis using Python using various data analysis libraries.

You can reach me via email at [joshuajarvis10@hotmail.co.uk](mailto:joshuajarvis10@hotmail.co.uk) or message me on [LinkedIn:](https://www.linkedin.com/in/josh-jarvis-3413a3190/)

**Upcoming projects:**
+ Transfer of automated assessment tool project from GitLab to GitHub
+ Rework of an old meal planner website built using vanilla JavaScript, HTML and CSS. The rework will use React.
