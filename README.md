Hi, Iâ€™m Josh.

You can find a bit about me and my portfolio on my website [here](http://www.josh-jarvis.com/).

I'm spending most evenings playing around with React whilst conducting research for my MSc Dissertation.
For my dissertation I am also developing my knowledge of data analysis using Python using various data analysis libraries.

After completing my MSc dissertation on comparing the effects of pronouns between English and Russian misinformation (using NLP techniques) I have been working on several projects.

I am currently building iOS applications using Swift alongside graphic designer Harry Greedy.

Our most recent application is a mock up for a sushi bar based in London. The repo can be found [here](https://github.com/JoJar/SakuraSushiBarApp).

Our future projects include an application for tourism which is focussed on London and small to medium sized businesses.
